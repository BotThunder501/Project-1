# Project 1

This README file will document my journey of creating this website that will be about building PCs.  
It is targeted towards people interested in building PCs mainly new people as building PCs can seem very daunting.  
The contents of the page will have each component needed to build a PC, what each component does and how they all fit to make a working PC.  
Below is a wireframe of how the website will look on mobile and how it will look on a laptop/PC.
